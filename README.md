# AMSE/SAKI 2023 Project
This repository is my submission of the AMSE/SAKI module 2023. It is forked from the [template project](https://github.com/jvalue/2023-amse-template).
This repository contains (a) a data science project that has been developed over the course of the semester, and (b) the exercises that are submitted over the course of the semester.


## Project Setup
The following files are part of the final project, and are located in the project folder: 

- `data.sqlite`: Is the final filtered and processed dataset. It is created in three steps. First an automated data pipeline will load the data from multiple open data sources. Next a filter removes all data that is not needed. Finally the data is processed to access the results faster. 
- `exploration.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that is used to explore the data from the open data sources. It shows the number of total datasets, unique value and the value ranges of the relevant data.
- `report.ipynb`: The final report as a Jupyter notebook. Shows the question of the project with its final answer. The answer uses a combination of maps and bar graphs to visualize the result.


## Exercises
The `exercises` folder in the repository contains the results of the exercises that had to be completed over the semester. Exercises one, three and five are completed in [Python](https://www.python.org/) while exercises two and four are completed using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee).

### Exercise Feedback
The automated exercise feedback is:
```sh
